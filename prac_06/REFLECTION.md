# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

With some technical changes, such as learning class, I can organize and call some elements more efficiently.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

What I also need to change is that sometimes my attitude towards code writing is not very rigorous, 
so that my code sometimes deviates from the desired result of the topic.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

What I do better now is that I write code very efficiently, and I will finish the code at certain times. 
I will always keep it in the future.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

What I need to stop now is that sometimes there are mistakes and omissions in the code I wrote, 
such as deviations from the requirements of the problem, and so on. I want to stop it.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I don't have any particular recommendations for this course or this degree, and I want it to stay that way.
